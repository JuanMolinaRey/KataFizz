# KataFizz
## Kata description:
### 
- Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100.
- Usually just print the number itself.
- For multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number.
- For multiples of five print Buzzen instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print FizzBuzz instead of the number.
## Project description:
### 
- Use a FOR to output the number 1 to 100
- I used a conditional so that I got Fizz plus the number when it was divisible by 3.
- Use a conditional to get Buzz plus the number when it was divisible by 5.
- I used a conditional so that I got FizzBuzz instead of the number when it was divisible by 3 and 5.

## Test description:
###
- I made a class called FizzBuzz where I use three methods to generate the Tests.
- In each Test I used the fizzbuzz object plus an Assert of true or false so that the class method would give me an error if the number was not divisible.
